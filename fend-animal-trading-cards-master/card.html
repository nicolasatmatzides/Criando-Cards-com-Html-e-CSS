		<p>Donald's aggressive nature has its advantages,
			 however. While at times it is a hindrance, and
			 even a handicap, it has also helped him in
			 times of need. When faced with a threat of
			 some kind, for example, Pete's attempts to
			 intimidate him, he is initially scared, but his
			  fear is replaced by anger. Instead of running
				away, he fightsâ€”with ghosts, sharks, and even
				the forces of nature.</p>
